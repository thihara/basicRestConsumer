# basicRestConsumer
How to write a basic Rest service consumer (client) with a Gson and Java SE libraries.

This application uses standard JavaSE libraries to consume a REST service endpoint. It uses
[Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) to parse the JSON responses.

It also uses TestNG for basic unit testing.

You can play with the app by opening it in your IDE, I've used intelliJ IDEA.
